1. Process Data. 

2. Sort Data.

3. Work out differences in pairs.

4. Calculate Sum.

[5.] Ensure diagnostic view and output final value. 

-> [with given input data set the no. of iterations.]
Option 1 -> 1000000:
- Use bubble sort. 
- With each iteration and each added sorted element, compute difference and add to sum. 

Option 2 -> 7000:
- Use merge sort. -> heap sort due to space complexity O(1)
- Sort both lists 
- Traverse through computing difference and summing. 


Function to calculate the difference and add to total.
* dif needs to be i32
arr1
arr2
total

function computeDifference(i : int) {
    
    # Compute absolute difference 
    diff = arr[1] - arr[2]
    if diff < 0:
        diff *= -1

    total += diff
}
